# Sweap Public API Resources

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for **Sweap's Public API ecosystem**.  
Here you'll find example projects, best practices, helper libraries, and SDKs for working with Sweap's APIs - designed to make your event automation workflows faster, cleaner, and more scalable.

## 🧭 What is Sweap?

Sweap is an event automation platform that helps companies create, manage, and optimize professional events - whether in-person, virtual, or hybrid.  
We offer secure, RESTful APIs for integrating key event workflows into your own systems or applications.
